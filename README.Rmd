# IATscores

A package to compute several types of scores for the Implicit Association Test, including the D scores (Greenwald, Nosek, Banaji, 2003) and the new scores that were developed using robust statistics (Richetin, Costantini, Perugini, and Schonbrodt, 2015, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129601). 

## Installation

You can install IATscores from CRAN with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("IATscores")
```

You can install IATscores from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GiulioCostantini/IATscores")
```

If you experience problems, try installing the github version. I fix bugs in github before submitting the updates to CRAN.
