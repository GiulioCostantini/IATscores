# IATscores

A package to compute several types of scores for the Implicit Association Test, including the D scores (Greenwald, Nosek, Banaji, 2003) and the new scores that were developed using robust statistics (Richetin, Costantini, Perugini, and Schonbrodt, 2015). 

For more information, please see the publication in PLoS one

## Installation

You can install IATscores from CRAN with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("IATscores")
```

You can install IATscores from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GiulioCostantini/IATscores")
```

If you experience problems, try installing the github version. I fix bugs in github before submitting the updates to CRAN. The CRAN version however can sometimes be more stable.
